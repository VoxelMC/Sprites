# Sprites
Hello, i am VoxelMC and I am a developer for a few Terraria mods, this is where i put my sprites for safekeeping. You can take any sprites from the "Unused" folder, but be sure to email me that you did at "voxel2@hotmail.com", if you don't I will request that you move it from your creation. DO NOT take sprites from the "Used" folder.
<br>ANY SPRITES THAT YOU USED I MUST BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR.
